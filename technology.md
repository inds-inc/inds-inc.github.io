## Technology Services

Managing nonclinical data can be challenging. Preparing reports and regulatory
submissions from disparate systems is time-consuming and costly. Soon sponsors
will be required to submit data to FDA in SEND format. You need compliant and
user-friendly applications that aggregate data, facilitate data review and
decision-making, shorten timelines, and reduce costs. You want data
visualization and analysis tools that will give you the ability to ensure data
quality, identify patterns and trends in the data, develop predictive models,
mine historical data, and allow you to increase the value of your research
investment. You want to work with information technology professionals who have
proven experience in developing solutions for life sciences customers.

Let the INDS team put their extensive toxicology domain knowledge to work for
you!
