Integrated Nonclinical Development Solutions, Inc. (INDS, Inc.) is
pleased to announce the release of SEND Explorer® Product Family v6.0.
SEND Explorer®, SEND Explorer® Plus, and SEND Explorer® Warehouse are
validated, web-based applications designed by scientists to provide
advanced viewing, data summarization, and visualization capabilities for
study data produced in SEND (Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data)
format. SEND Explorer® Product Family v6.0 provides a scalable solution
to allow your organization to leverage its investment in SEND data.

Single-study enhancements in SEND Explorer® v6.0 include the following:

-   Study Overview Page to give scientists the option to create/identify
    Notes, Image files, Links, and “Endpoints of Interest” and share
    them with other users

-   Multi-Endpoint Line Graph to give scientists the opportunity to plot
    one or more endpoints within or across domains on separate, adjacent
    plots and the option to produce subplots by treatment, dose, or sex

-   Exposure Plot to help scientists assess correlation between a
    selected exposure endpoint and a selected LB endpoint

-   Schedule View to produce a chronological summary of endpoints
    collected across time

-   Subject View enhancements allowing the scientist to see all
    non-normal tissue findings for a given subject and the ability to
    simultaneously include endpoints that were flagged as being of
    interest in subject view

-   Ability to capture ad hoc endpoints of interest from summary
    displays and apply these endpoints to selected visualizations

Multi-Study enhancements include the following new visualizations:

-   Multi-Study Histopathology Bar Chart to reveal patterns and trends
    in histopathology findings within and across studies

-   Multi-Study Subject Compare View to allow scientists to display
    selected endpoints from subjects of interest within or across
    studies

**SEND Explorer**® features include:

-   A robust data grid that merges subject and group metadata with
    associated results

-   Advanced data management and query features such as column
    hiding/showing, sorting, and filtering

-   Ability to export all or filtered data to Excel

-   Pivoting of data by timepoint, test code, and/or subject

-   Group summary and incidence calculations based on a user-specified
    group definition

-   Option to configure application to perform Dunnett's t-test for
    pairwise comparison to concurrent controls\*

-   Scientifically-relevant data visualizations including scatterplots
    of subject data, group mean bar charts, Multi-Endpoint\* Line Graph
    with error bars, Clinical Observations Timecourse visualization,
    Exposure Plot\*, Schedule View\*, cross-domain Subject View, and
    Severity Heatmaps™

-   Reference range highlighting and calculated %change from control
    group mean

-   Hyperlink to comments and supplemental qualifiers

-   Hyperlink to multi-domain subject view with tabular and graphical
    displays of data

-   The ability to create and save report and visualization presets so
    they can be recalled and subsequently applied to the same or any
    other study\*  
    \**Features new to Version 6.0*

**SEND Explorer**® **Plus** includes all of the above features as well
as:

-   Straight-forward load interface and study dashboard

-   Fully-compliant SEND-based data model

-   Study overview page containing a free-text field for capturing
    scientific observations and notes, loaded image files, hyperlinks to
    other documents or web-pages of interest, and a list of endpoints of
    interest for sharing with others in your organization\*

-   Ability for user to capture and retain endpoints of interest while
    reviewing summary data\*

-   Ability to apply ad hoc endpoints of interest en masse to selected
    visualizations\*

-   Multi-study/multi-domain data grid for querying across domains and
    studies

-   Multi-study Correlations Matrix visualization with tissue-finding
    indicators and drill-down to subject data

-   Multi-study Timecourse Grid visualization permitting comparison of
    selected endpoint across studies and over time

-   Multi-study Treemap visualization to identify relative prevalence of
    Histopathology findings across studies weighted by any of a number
    of severity-based weighting algorithms

-   Multi-Study Histopathology Barchart to facilitate recognition and
    communication of patterns in histopathology findings\*

-   Multi-Study Subject Compare chart providing side-by-side comparison
    of subject findings from within or across studies\*

-   Multi-Study Historical Control Values Distribution visualization,
    revealing the distribution of numeric endpoints in control subjects,
    differentiable by sex, species, vehicle, test facility, supplier,
    subject age, etc.  
    \**Features new to Version 6.0*

**SEND Explorer**® **Warehouse** includes all of the above features as
well as:

-   Web-based\* administrative interface for term reconciliation, to
    view/modify mapped terms, and to specify unit transformations

-   Ability to register new source systems and connectors to integrate
    legacy data

-   Ability to load, reload, or delete individual domains or an entire
    study

-   Ability to load non-SEND data via generic spreadsheet loader\*

-   Ability to review load history and load history details to help
    identify and correct data errors

-   Ability to load data on-demand or according to a specified
    schedule  
    \**Features new to Version 6.0*
