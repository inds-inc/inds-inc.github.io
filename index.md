Nonclinical aspects of drug development can be particularly challenging,
especially if you're going it alone. You need broad-based toxicology expertise
and hands-on drug development experience that can be hard to find in an
individual consultant. You also need efficient processes and systems to generate
and report your nonclinical data. No matter the size of your organization, you
are being asked to produce more with the same or fewer internal resources, to do
it faster, and to be more agile. To deliver, you need outside resources that
provide the high quality support and products your project requires - on time
and within budget. That's where INDS Inc. can help.

### The INDS Advantage

The specialized, complementary expertise of our team members enables INDS to
provide you drug development support from target selection to product
registration. Our data management and information technology specialists work
closely with our toxicologists to deliver software solutions that truly reflect
end-user needs for ease-of-use and flexibility. Our team consists of board
certified toxicologists, veterinarians, and information technology and business
operations experts with more than 100 years of combined experience in the
pharmaceutical and contract research industries.

### Our Experience

-   Advancing over 120 compounds in all major therapeutic areas to clinical
    trials, using both traditional and alternative paradigms, including filing
    industry's first exploratory IND.

    (Cognex®, ReZulin®, Neurontin®, LYRICA®) and the world's best selling drug

    warehousing, data visualization, interpretations and automated
