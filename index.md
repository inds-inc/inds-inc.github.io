Nonclinical aspects of drug development can be particularly challenging,
especially if you're going it alone. You need broad-based toxicology expertise
and hands-on drug development experience that can be hard to find in an
individual consultant. You also need efficient processes and systems to generate
and report your nonclinical data. No matter the size of your organization, you
are being asked to produce more with the same or fewer internal resources, to do
it faster, and to be more agile. To deliver, you need outside resources that
provide the high quality support and products your project requires - on time
and within budget. That's where INDS Inc. can help.
