Integrated Nonclinical Development Solutions, Inc. (INDS, Inc.) is
pleased to announce the release of **SEND Explorer® Product
Family v7.0**, a validated, web-based application designed by scientists
to provide advanced viewing, data summarization, and visualization
capabilities for study data produced in SEND (Standard for Exchange of
Nonclinical Data) 3.0 format or SEND 3.1 format. SEND Explorer Products
allow organizations to leverage their investment in creating SEND
datasets for regulatory submissions by making study data accessible to
scientists.  

**New features for the v7.0 release include the following:**

  - Multi-Endpoint Line Graph now provides option to produce subplots by
    subject in addition to treatment, dose, or sex.

  - Visualization of %change from baseline values in Summary View and
    Multi-Endpoint Line Graph, where baseline is identified.

  - Support of Cross-Over study design - multi-endpoint line graph,
    summary view, and cross-over scatter visualizations.

  - User-requested enhancement to Exposure Plot to plot actual dose
    level vs exposure

  - Update all Histopathology visualizations to accommodate modified
    standard SEND terms for severity

  - Interface for updating configuration settings

  - Mouse-over any excluded value (identified with greyed-out text) to
    display reason for exclusion (if it exists)

  - Ability to create, save, and apply User Presets and Shared Presets.

  - Ability to summarize and plot % change from baseline for any
    endpoint where the baseline value has been flagged in SEND

  - Ability to embolden or suppress one or more lines in Multi-Endpoint
    Line Graph: lines associate with either group means or individual
    subject values

  - Client-suggested usability improvements

  - Ability to filter Summary View for endpoints meeting criteria of
    interest

  - Ability to navigate to a different subject in Subject View by
    clicking on a plotted point in any visualization thumbnail

  - Ability to collapse single-study histopathology findings across all
    severities, to sort subjects by disposition day, or filter for
    tissues of interest

  - Ability automatically load data saved to a designated Watch Folder
    location

  - Ability to load non-SEND data as a primary or secondary source via
    spreadsheet

<span style="color:limegreen;font-weight:bold">SEND Explorer</span> 
provides single-study functionality including the
ability to review and query SEND data; generate scientifically-relevant
visualizations to identify trends and patterns within a study; and
review all data for a single subject to compare vs other subjects in its
group or vs control subjects to identify patterns across endpoints of
interest, at a given timepoint and over time.

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">SEND Explorer Plus</span> 
additionally includes a SEND-optimized database
to extend SEND Explorer functionality to the multi-study environment and
provides powerful yet intuitive cross-study querying capabilities and
multi-study visualizations. The database version also allows users to
save and reapply settings to the same or different studies, to display %
change from baseline values, and identify and filter for endpoints of
interest.

**SEND Explorer Warehouse** provides the same visualization capabilities
as SEND Explorer Plus and additionally includes a data warehouse
infrastructure which enables organizations to combine legacy/non-SEND
data sources with their SEND data, connect to non-SEND data sources,
perform advanced term reconciliation functionality, and refresh internal
data sources on a schedule.

<span style="color:limegreen;font-weight:bold">SEND Explorer</span>

    out-of-control-range criteria\*

  - Hyperlink to comments and supplemental qualifiers

  - Hyperlink to multi-domain Subject View with tabular and graphical
