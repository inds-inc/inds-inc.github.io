Integrated Nonclinical Development Solutions, Inc. (INDS, Inc.) is
pleased to announce the release of **SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Product Family
v9.0**, a validated, web-based application designed by scientists to
provide advanced viewing, data summarization, and visualization
capabilities for study data produced in SEND (Standard for Exchange of
Nonclinical Data) 3.0 format or SEND 3.1 format. SEND Explorer Products
allow organizations to leverage their investment in creating SEND
datasets for regulatory submissions by making study data accessible to
scientists for decision-making.

**New features for the v9.0 release include the following:**

<u>Single-Study Enhancements</u>

-   Provide new navigation options in standard grid and summary views
-   Ability to plot upper and lower reference range values as provided
    in SEND dataset on Summary by Timepoint thumbnail scatterplots
-   Additional plot by fields and summary measure (Geometric Mean)
-   User-requested enhancements in Subject View
-   Allow users to flag endpoints and/or tissues of interest within
    Subject View
-   Enable Severity Heatmap to filter by Toxicity Profile
-   Provide tabular Summary View for Severity Heatmap, showing group
    totals and suppressing findings for individual subjects
-   Ability to export most single-study visualizations in high-quality
    SVG or PNG format
-   Support for IS domain (standard grid and summary view)
-   Support for Custom domains (WH only)
-   Option to display data from most domains in CTD format
-   Option to save data in XPT/CSV/XLS format

<u>Multi-Study Enhancements</u>

-   Provide advanced (Boolean) querying functionality in Multi-Study
    Grid for Super Users, Data Stewards, and Administrators
-   Support numerous additional filter fields in Multi-Study
    Visualizations
-   Re-engineer Correlations Matrix to improve performance and add
    functionality (including best fit lines)
-   Select box plot, mean + stddev, or mean + stderr in Scatterplot
    Timecourse, Clin Path vs Histo Severity or Exposure vs Histo
    Severity plots
-   Provide Align by Dose in Scatterplot Timecourse, Clin Path vs Histo
    Severity, and Exposure vs Histo Severity plots
-   Ability to export multi-study visualizations in high-quality SVG or
    PNG format
-   Enhanced single- and multi-study logging features and ability to add
    custom admin reports to Admin dashboard
-   Performance improvements for multi-study grid and multi-study
    visualizations

<u>Study Loading Improvements</u>

-   Only newly uploaded or changed finding records are processed to
    minimize load time
-   User-requested study loading efficiency improvements, including the
    ability to add/remove studies from the load queue via the Dashboard

**<u><span style="color:limegreen">SEND Explorer</span></u>** provides single-study functionality including the
ability to review and query SEND data; generate
scientifically-relevant visualizations to identify trends and patterns
within a study; and review all data for a single subject to compare vs
other subjects in its group or vs control subjects to identify
patterns across endpoints of interest, at a given timepoint and over
time.

**<u><span style="color:blue">SEND Explorer Plus</span></u>** additionally includes a SEND-optimized database
to extend SEND Explorer functionality to the multi-study environment
and provides powerful yet intuitive cross-study querying capabilities
and multi-study visualizations. SEND Explorer Plus also allows users
to save and reapply settings to the same or different studies, to
display % change from baseline values, and identify and filter for
endpoints of interest.

**<u>SEND Explorer Warehouse</u>** provides the same visualization
capabilities as SEND Explorer Plus and additionally includes a data
warehouse infrastructure which enables organizations to combine
legacy/non-SEND data sources with their SEND data, connect to non-SEND
data sources, support for custom domains, advanced term reconciliation
functionality, and refresh internal data sources on a schedule.

**<u><span style="color:gold">SEND Explorer Gold</span></u>** provides all of the functionality of SEND
Explorer Warehouse except for the ability to support custom domains,
reconcile terms, override data, or match subject numbers across
sources. As with SEND Explorer Warehouse, the data it consumes does
not need to be in SEND format so this product is a good fit for
organizations who want a direct connection to a data collection
system, non-SEND interim data, or a legacy format without the need for
cross-study reconciliation of terms.
