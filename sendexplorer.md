Integrated Nonclinical Development Solutions, Inc. (INDS, Inc.) is
pleased to announce the release of **SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Product
Family v5.0**.  These validated, web-based applications were designed by
scientists to provide advanced viewing, data summarization, and
visualization capabilities for study data produced in SEND (Standard for
Exchange of Nonclinical Data) format.  

Three new visualizations have been included in the V5.0 release:

- A new single-study line graph has been introduced for numeric timecourse data.
  Group means are plotted by study day with the option to display error bars and 
  drill down to view the individual subject that comprise the group mean.

- A new single-study clinical observations timecourse visualization has been 
  included which depicts the progression of clinical observations over time.  

= A new multi-study visualization has been included which displays the 
  distribution of numeric historical control data.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Product Family v5.0** provides a scalable
solution to allow your organization to leverage its investment in SEND
data.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup>** provides single-study functionality
including the ability to view and query SEND data, generate group
summarizations with scientifically-relevant visualizations to identify
trends and patterns within a study, and review all data for a single
subject to compare vs other subjects in its group or vs control
subjects, to identify patterns within or across data types, at a given
timepoint and over time.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Plus** includes a database to extend SEND
Explorer functionality to the multi-study environment and provides
powerful yet intuitive cross-study querying capabilities and multi-study
visualizations.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Warehouse** provides a data warehouse
infrastructure that will enable your organization to combine
legacy/non-SEND data sources with your SEND data, to perform advanced
term reconciliation functionality, or to refresh internal data sources
on a schedule.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup>** features include:

-   A robust data grid that merges subject and group metadata with
    associated results

-   Advanced data management and query features such as column
    hiding/showing, sorting, and filtering

-   Ability to export all or filtered data to Excel

-   Pivoting of data by timepoint, test code, and/or subject

-   Group summary and incidence calculations based on a user-specified
    group definition

-   Scientifically-relevant data visualizations including scatterplots
    of subject data, group mean bar charts, and Severity Heatmaps™

-   Reference range highlighting and calculated %change from control
    group mean

-   Hyperlink to comments and supplemental qualifiers

-   Hyperlink to multi-domain subject view with tabular and graphical
    displays of data

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Plus** includes all of the above features as
well as:

-   Straight-forward load interface and study dashboard

-   Fully-compliant SEND-based data model

-   Multi-study/multi-domain data query grid

-   Hyperlinked related records

-   Multi-study Correlations Matrix visualization with tissue-finding
    indicators and drill-down to subject data

-   Multi-study Timecourse Grid visualization permitting comparison of
    endpoint across studies and over time

-   Multi-study Treemap visualization facilitating recognition and
    communication of patterns in histopathology findings.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Warehouse** includes all of the above
features as well as:

-   Administrative tool to allow term reconciliation, to view/modify
    mapped terms, to specify unit transformations, and to identify
    number of decimal places for display

-   Ability to register new source systems and connectors to integrate
    legacy data

-   Ability to load, reload, or delete individual domains or an entire
    study

-   Ability to review load history and load history details to help
    identify and correct data errors

-   Ability to load data on-demand or according to a specified schedule

Products in the **SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Product Family v5.0** are
now available for purchase. INDS has recently partnered with Instem for
sales and support services. Please contact INDS at
<sendexperts@inds-inc.com> or Instem at <submit@instem.com> for more
information on any of these tools or to request a demo.
