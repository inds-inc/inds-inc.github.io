Integrated Nonclinical Development Solutions, Inc. (INDS, Inc.) is
pleased to announce the release of **SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Product
Family v4.1**.  These validated, web-based applications were designed by
scientists to provide advanced viewing, data summarization, and
visualization capabilities for study data produced in SEND (Standard for
Exchange of Nonclinical Data) format.  

New features for the v4.1 release include the following:

-   Enhancements to Summary View giving user option to display group
    summary statistics with or without accompanying subject details.
    Group means outside of the range of concurrent control group
    are flagged.

-   Multiple improvements to the Subject View, including ability to
    produce adjacent visualizations for male and female groups, enhanced
    filtering capabilities and ability to select endpoints associated
    with various Toxicity Profiles

-   Allow organizations to include their own branding of SEND Explorer
    and specify their own Toxicity Profiles.

-   Modifications to improve system performance for very large
    (e.g., carcinogenicity) studies

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Product Family v4.1** provides a scalable
solution to allow your organization to leverage its investment in SEND
data. **SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup>** provides single-study functionality
including the ability to review/QC SEND datasets prior to submission to
FDA, generate group summarizations with scientifically-relevant
visualizations to identify trends and patterns within a study, and
review all data for a single subject to compare vs other subjects in its
group or vs control subjects, to identify patterns within or across data
types, at a given timepoint and over time. **SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup>
Plus** includes a database to extend SEND Explorer functionality to the
multi-study environment and provides powerful yet intuitive cross-study
querying capabilities and multi-study visualizations. **SEND
Explorer<sup>®</sup> Warehouse** provides a data warehouse
infrastructure that will enable your organization to combine
legacy/non-SEND data sources with your SEND data, to perform advanced
term reconciliation functionality, or to refresh internal data sources
on a schedule.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup>** features include:

-   A robust data grid that merges subject and group metadata with
    associated results

-   Advanced data management and query features such as column
    hiding/showing, sorting, and filtering

-   Ability to export all or filtered data to Excel

-   Pivoting of data by timepoint, test code, and/or subject

-   Group summary and incidence calculations based on a user-specified
    group definition

-   Scientifically-relevant data visualizations including scatterplots
    of subject data, group mean bar charts, and Severity Heatmaps™

-   Reference range highlighting and calculated %change from control
    group mean

-   Hyperlink to comments and supplemental qualifiers

-   Hyperlink to multi-domain subject view with tabular and graphical
    displays of data

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Plus** includes all of the above features as
well as:

-   Straight-forward load interface and study dashboard

-   Fully-compliant SEND-based data model

-   Multi-study/multi-domain data query grid

-   Hyperlinked related records

-   Multi-study Correlations Matrix visualization with tissue-finding
    indicators and drill-down to subject data

-   Multi-study Timecourse Grid visualization permitting comparison of
    endpoint across studies and over time

-   Multi-study Treemap visualization facilitating recognition and
    communication of patterns in histopathology findings.

**SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Warehouse** includes all of the above
features as well as:

-   Administrative tool to allow term reconciliation, to view/modify
    mapped terms, to specify unit transformations, and to identify
    number of decimal places for display

-   Ability to register new source systems and connectors to integrate
    legacy data

-   Ability to load, reload, or delete individual domains or an entire
    study

-   Ability to review load history and load history details to help
    identify and correct data errors

-   Ability to load data on-demand or according to a specified schedule

Products in the **SEND Explorer<sup>®</sup> Product Family v4.1** are
now available for purchase. INDS has recently partnered with Instem for
sales and support services. Please contact INDS at
