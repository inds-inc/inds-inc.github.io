INDS Inc. will unveil SEND Explorer™ Product Family Version 4.0 at SOT.
In anticipation of the FDA mandate for sponsors to submit study data in
SEND (Standard Exchange of Nonclinical Data) starting late 2016, the
SEND Explorer Product Family was developed by scientists for scientists.
Our validated, web‑based applications provide advanced querying, data
review and summarization, and single- and multi-study visualizations for
study data produced in SEND. Stop by Booth 753 to find out how the SEND
Explorer Product Family can help your organization make the most of your
investment in SEND. Ask for a demonstration of our newest visualization,
the Multi-Study Histopathology Treemap, and receive a special gift!
