### Instem Signs Agreement with Integrated Nonclinical Development Solutions, Inc.; Becomes Exclusive Global Supplier of SEND Explorer®

**CONSHOHOCKEN, PA - (BUSINESS WIRE) – July 29, 2016 -**
[Instem](http://www.instem.com/), a leading provider
of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>[IT
solutions](http://www.instem.com/solutions)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>to
the global early development healthcare market, announced today that it
has reached an agreement with Integrated Nonclinical Development
Solutions, Inc. (“INDS”) to market, sell and support its SEND Explorer
solution worldwide.

SEND Explorer provides advanced single and multi-study viewing, data
summarization, and visualization capabilities for study data produced
in[SEND](http://www.instem.com/industries/send.php)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(Standard
for Exchange of Nonclinical Data) format.  SEND Explorer is an intuitive
web-based application with optional data warehousing capabilities
allowing data sources other than SEND to be integrated and available for
querying and analysis.  

“SEND Explorer is the perfect complement to Instem’s
current<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>[SEND
offerings](http://www.instem.com/solutions/submit/index.php),” comments
Jennifer Feldmann, Vice President of SEND Product Strategy at Instem. 
“Our clients can create and manage their SEND datasets using submit™, QC
the datasets
with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>[SENDView™](http://www.instem.com/solutions/sendview/)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>to
ensure a submission-ready package, and use those SEND datasets with SEND
Explorer as part of the ongoing analysis to support the scientific
findings submitted with a drug application.”

Instem views SEND Explorer as an effective solution for organizations to
further leverage their investment in SEND data. The SEND Explorer
solution, an INDS technology, will become an integral part of
Instem’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>[submit solution
suite.](http://www.instem.com/solutions/submit/index.php)

“INDS designed SEND Explorer to help scientists efficiently visualize
and communicate data patterns and trends within and across studies,
thereby accelerating the drug evaluation process,” states Joyce Zandee,
Chief Operating Officer at INDS. “As the global SEND market leader,
Instem has both the expertise and resources to make SEND Explorer
accessible to scientists at large and small organizations, allowing our
industry to greatly benefit from the data standardization imposed by
SEND.”

Instem
developed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>[submit](http://www.instem.com/solutions/submit/),
the first commercially available SEND software solution in 2005 and its
comprehensive set of tools are now the most widely adopted in the
market, supporting over 45 client sites across 15 countries. The submit
platform is meeting the very wide range of demands that span the needs
of the largest multi-national pharmaceutical organizations and CROs to
the smallest organizations and their advisors.

During this period of preparation and especially following FDA’s long
awaited final guidance (December 18, 2014) for standardized study data
for providing submissions in electronic format, the demand for
outsourced SEND services has rapidly grown. Now across every stage of
SEND-Readiness, clients can choose from one or more Instem
solution-services that will help them in their journey towards SEND
compliance, while minimizing the impact within their organization. This
includes the option for organizations to completely turn to Instem as
their fully-outsourced SEND department.
